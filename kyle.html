          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Kyle Little </h2> <h3><span class="text-muted">"Nothing is ever impossible to those who believe they can succeed."</span></h3>
          <p class="lead">My name is Kyle A. Little and currently I am a Year Up- Chicago student, this is an non-profit program focused on teaching urban youth technical skills and professionalism. During the learning and development phase my primary focus in the IT field is Hardware and Cyber security.  Use of these skills in the future will greatly help me grow in my career choices and where I want to be in life. Applying multiple skills I've learned down the way even in different fields is one of the things I consider being a key to success, making transferable skills very important to me adding the skills I learned from Hammond Area Career Center. 

          I enjoy applying not only the transferable skills I've developed but also my own creativity. I enjoy writing, reading, drawing, and dessert decoration. Those personal fun skills could be applied to professional field as well, especially if there is a new light needed on a problem. </p>

          <h2> <b>My Life into the tech field</b></h2>

  <p class="lead"> Born and raised in Chicago, I thoroughly enjoyed the city life. Even for a short period of time I moved to the suburbs of South Holland, those two years were a fun experience before moving back into the inner city. Even though I moved around a lot one thing stayed the same, I always loved technology rather it was taking it apart or putting it together. Though there were passing fancies in other career paths, I always wanted to be an electrical engineer and also dive deeper to the ever-growing computer based technologies. These goals were supported and instilled into me by being the youngest of three brothers I would always get blamed for breaking things and instead of getting in trouble I would try to learn how to fix it. Those incidents of exposure lead me down the path I am today, and further influence me to learn more skills to not only play on my interest but also build independence in life. </p>

  <h2><b> What is success to me?</b> </h2>

    <p class="lead"> The word success means many things to me, rather it is in my career choices, personal life, and professional life. It all means different things, there are standards that I like to live by, certain quotes, and morals. These things don’t always pertain to success, but an overall internal guidance which I believe is very important to have as a man making transitions in his life.</p>
    <p class="lead">
  In my career choices; I just want to be happy with what I do. I want to come to work enthusiastic and excited to see what I’ll be doing or what I’ll learn that day. I am always willing to learn, as it is a standard that I like to guide myself by, calling myself a student of life, diving into new notes of knowledge to broaden my horizon.
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
  As for my personal view on success, I want to not struggle and have the amount of stability to help others so they can stand on their own again. I hate to see people struggle and watch their potential just stay as unused energy due to circumstances that impacted them hard and had no support or due to a unforeseen problem that they couldn’t prepare for. With the mentality of “Meet me half way” I believe that I could help much more than just simple enabling, it wouldn’t be success to me if it was. I want to really help someone and hopefully change their life for the better while helping myself to become a good person in this world. </p>
  <p class="lead">
  Within my career success and personal success, there lays my idea of professional success. The points touched on with happiness and support of the people in my life speaks to how I want to be in the work place. Even though by nature I am an independent person, I would love to be able to work on a team doing something I enjoy and contributing valuable information to the group. When someone depends on me to do a task it motivates me to do it to the best of my ability and beyond by even learning a new technique that helps. To me being of use as a professional means I’m successful in my endeavors, that challenge motivates me as well and  it’s something that I have come to crave in my life.
